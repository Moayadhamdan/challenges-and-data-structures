# Min Stack Challenge

## Challenge Description:
Implement a MinStack class in C# that supports standard stack operations, including Push, Pop, Top, IsEmpty, and PrintStack. Additionally, the stack should efficiently provide the minimum element with constant time complexity using the GetMin method. Ensure that all operations, especially retrieving the minimum value, are optimized for performance.
