# Binary Tree - Level with Maximum Number of Nodes

## Challenge Description:
Implement a method to find the level of a binary tree with the maximum number of nodes. To solve this, perform a level-by-level traversal of the tree (using breadth-first search), keeping track of the number of nodes at each level. As you traverse, compare the node count of each level to identify the one with the highest count. This approach ensures that you accurately determine which level in the binary tree has the maximum number of nodes, providing insight into the tree's structure and distribution of nodes across its depth.
