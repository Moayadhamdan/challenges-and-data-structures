# Binary Tree - Print Right View

## Challenge Description:
Implement a method to print the right view of a binary tree. To solve this, traverse the tree level by level, capturing the rightmost node at each level, and return a list containing these nodes. This approach ensures that you accurately represent the visibility of the tree from the right side, providing a clear view of the structure at each depth of the binary tree.
