# Binary Tree - Mirror Tree

## Challenge Description:
The goal of this challenge is to implement a MirrorTree function for a binary tree. A mirror tree is a tree where each node's left and right children are swapped. This transformation should be applied recursively to all nodes in the tree. After mirroring the tree, the in-order traversal of the original and mirrored trees should be compared to ensure the mirroring was done correctly. This challenge involves modifying the tree structure in-place and validating the result through traversal.
