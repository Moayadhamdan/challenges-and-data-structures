# Binary Tree - Minimum Depth

## Challenge Description:
Implement a method to find the minimum depth of a binary tree. The minimum depth is defined as the shortest path from the root node to any leaf node (a node with no children). To solve this, perform a recursive traversal of the tree, visiting each node and determining the depth of its children. For each non-leaf node, the minimum depth is the smaller of the depths of its left and right subtrees. If a node has only one child, continue traversing that subtree to calculate its depth.
