# Binary Tree - Largest Value at Each Level

## Challenge Description:
Implement a method to find the largest value at each level of a binary tree. To solve this, traverse the tree level by level, track the maximum value at each level, and return a list containing these largest values. This approach ensures that you capture the highest value at each depth of the binary tree.
