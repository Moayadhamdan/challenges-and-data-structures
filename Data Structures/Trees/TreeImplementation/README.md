# Tree Implementation

## Challenge Description:
Implement a Binary Tree and a Binary Search Tree (BST) in C#. The Binary Tree will support traversal methods including Pre-Order, In-Order, and Post-Order, allowing you to explore the tree in different sequences. Additionally, the BST will include functionality to add, search, and remove nodes while maintaining the properties of a binary search tree. Your implementation will be tested with xUnit to ensure that the tree structure and operations work as expected, providing a robust solution for managing hierarchical data efficiently.
