# Binary Tree - Binary Tree to Binary Search Tree

## Challenge Description:
Implement a method to convert a Binary Tree into a Binary Search Tree (BST) while preserving the original structure of the tree. In this transformation, ensure that the in-order traversal of the tree gives a sorted sequence of values, as it would in a BST. To achieve this, first collect all values from the Binary Tree using an in-order traversal. Then, sort these values and assign them back to the nodes in another in-order traversal to create the BST. This method maintains the original tree shape while enforcing the properties of a BST.
