# Binary Tree - Second Maximum Value

## Challenge Description:
Implement a method to find the second maximum value in a binary tree. The maximum value is the largest value in the tree, while the second maximum is the largest value among the nodes that are less than the maximum. To solve this, traverse the tree recursively to identify and compare node values.
